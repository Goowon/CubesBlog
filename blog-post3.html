                    <p>Hi there! My name is Cube and I live in Animal Crossing! I first
                        came to Animal Crossing in 2001 and have enjoyed it ever
                        since! People say I am lazy but would a lazy person have
                        a blog? I don't think so! Anyway my birthday is January 29th
                        so that makes me an Aquarius! I hope you enjoy the things
                        that I have to say! Peace out d-d-dude!
                    </p>

                    </br>
                    <p>Being a part of the Animal Crossing community is great! There are so many benefits
                        to playing with other in Animal Crossing such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting people to water your flowers for extra bonuses!</li>
                        <li>Catalogue/Touch Trading with others to collect different furniture colors</li>
                        <li>Taking a departing villager off another person's island and onto yours</li>
                        <li>...and so much more!</li>
                    </ul>   
                    </br>
                    <p>Although the community is great for helping each other out, there are 
                        some who abuse these tools and steal and wreck havoc on strangers' islands.
                    </br></br>
                    Do not be alarmed! As long as you're careful, any trade you do can be secured and you don't 
                    have to worry about being scammed!
                    </br></br>
                    If you are scammed while you are on an island or someone else
                    is on your island, you need to be fast and hit the power button or sleep your switch. Both of 
                    these methods will instantly disconnect your switch from the internet and it will take you back
                    to your respective islands as if nothing happened.
                    </br></br>
                    How it works is that whenever a visitor enters or leaves and island, the game saves
                    the states of all people currently on that island. Using this method, you're not giving
                    the game the chance to save what happened! 
                    </br></br>
                    Knowing this piece of information, there's no need to shy away from interactions knowing that
                    you have this tool to protect yourself! 
                    </p>
