                    <h3><em>About Me</em></h3>
                    <p>Hi there! My name is Cube and I live in Animal Crossing! I first
                        came to Animal Crossing in 2001 and have enjoyed it ever
                        since! People say I am lazy but would a lazy person have
                        a blog? I don't think so! Anyway my birthday is January 29th
                        so that makes me an Aquarius! I hope you enjoy the things
                        that I have to say! Peace out d-d-dude!
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to KICK Villagers Off Your Island</h2>
                    <p>I don't know how or why this works but I found some guides
                        from reddit user kdog1000 and also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32Zl9G-oHTs">
                            YouTube video from TagBackTV</a>.
                        </br></br>
                        I have used my own modfied method to consistently kick out several villagers 
                        from my island and I will teach you how to do it here! Do keep in mind that 
                        this method will involve time travel and will take an extremely
                        long amount of time without it. Keep in mind that due to the time 
                        travel, your island could get a lot of weeds, mail, and bulletin 
                        board posts. If that's all fine with you, let's get into it. 
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Step One:</h3>
                    <img class="leftImg" src="images/SwitchSystemSS.png" alt="Picture of Switch
                    System Settings showing Date and Time">
                    <p>Time travel <em>at least</em> 14 days into the future.</br>
                        To time travel, have your game open and go into your switch settings
                        as seen in the picture to the left. Then after changing the date at
                        least 14 days in advance, come back into the game and then "Save
                        and Exit" by using the "-" button on your Switch. Once you exit to the main 
                        page and return to your game, it'll be the new date you selected.
                    </br></br>
                        Note that you don't want to time travel to a Saturday because
                        a villager won't leave when K.K. Slider is in town. So if the date
                        14 days later is a Saturday, do 15 days instead and go to a Sunday.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Step Two:</h3>
                    <img class="leftImg" src="images/ZuckerThoughtBubble.png" alt="Image of 
                    Zucker thinking about leaving">
                    <p>Once you're back in the game, you want to look around for island for a
                        villager that has a cloud above their head, similarly to the image on
                        the side. These villagers will be outside so there's no need to go 
                        into any houses.
                    </br></br>
                        Once you find the villager, if it is someone you
                        want to leave, great! You're done! Talk to them and they will ask
                        you if they should leave your island and you can urge them to move
                        on. 
                    </br></br>
                        If they're not the villager you want to kick out, go back into 
                        your switch settings and skip to the next day. Then "Save and Exit" 
                        to the main page and get back into the game. Repeat until you find
                        the villager that you want to kick out! Remember to skip Saturdays!
                    </br></br>
                        Note: You don't have to talk to them villager with the cloud if it
                        is not the one you want to kick out. They wont leave on their own
                        so you don't have to worry about that.
                    </br></br> Good Luck and I hope y'all can get all your dreamies!
                    </p>
