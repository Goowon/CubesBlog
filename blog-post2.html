                    <p>Hi there! My name is Cube and I live in Animal Crossing! I first
                        came to Animal Crossing in 2001 and have enjoyed it ever
                        since! My <b>friends</b> say I am lazy but would a lazy person have
                        a blog? I don't think so! My favorite saying is <q>Sometimes you need
                        to learn to chill.</q> I hope you enjoy the things that I have to say!
                        Peace out d-d-dude!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Tools to Help You Design Your Island</h2>
                    <p>Click on the names of each tool to go to the tools' website!</p>

                    3D Island Planner</a>
                    <p>Anyone that took a stab at terraforming knows how time consuming it can
                        be, especially when each block takes around a second and a half to edit.
                        This tool is great because it allows you to quickly edit the map in its
                        editor and supports placing buildings and adding rivers to the terrain.
                    </p>
                    <a class="DesignToolLink" href="https://eugeneration.github.io/HappyIslandDesigner/" target="_blank">
                    Happy Island Designer</a>
                    <p>As great as the first tool is, it might be slow if you're not running it on 
                        a great pc. The second tool is a great pixel editor of the island that allows
                        for editing the island according to the minimap!
                    </br></br>
                    I would recommend using the Happy Island Designer to design the overall idea of 
                    your island and then go deep into the details if possible using the 3D Island Planner.
